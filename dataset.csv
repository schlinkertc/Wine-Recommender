Chardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?

Chardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects “terroir” (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.

Sonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics. Napa Valley Chards lean toward a riper and fuller style, with tropical fruit notes. Oak aging adds layers of vanilla, spice, butter and toasted hazelnut.

Oakier Chards with a slightly buttery profile have a natural affinity with rich seafood such as lobster or halibut. They also stand up well to eggs benedict, pork chops stuffed with apples or roasted butternut squash. Crisper, unoaked Chards are best paired with prawns, crab cakes, salads with mangos and or even mild curries.",53,3.4,,0.3967636022514071,0.26104093218206237,,,

Chardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?

Chardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects “terroir” (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.

Sonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics.

As with other famous regions that produce this Noble grape, Oregon's Pinot Noir can be as sophisticated and compelling as a fine red Burgundy.

While the wine industry in Oregon is relatively young, world-class wines, especially Pinot Noir have come from this cool climate region for years.

The heart of the Oregon wine industry lies in the Willamette Valley, and has a similar latitude and climate as Burgundy. Pinot Noir first made its way to this picturesque region in 1959, thanks to the man who is widely credited as the father of Oregon Pinot Noir, Richard Sommers. He planted the first vines in Umpqua Valley and later established HillCrest Vineyard in Roseberg, in 1961.

Pinot Noir is challenging to grow, it's a small vine with tight clusters, and is susceptible to issues like rot and mildew. Known as the “heartbreak grape”, it can be a headache for winemakers and vineyard managers alike, yet is grown all over the world, and can command higher prices than other varieties for this reason.

Oregon Pinot is excellent paired with pork tenderloin, duck, cedar plank salmon, and just about anything with wild mushrooms.",11992,3.6,,0.17329779686691082,0.1161014524781024,,,"Aromas of cherries, raspberries, and blackberries.

Pinot Noir reflects its terroir, or place of origin, more than just about any other variety. That's certainly part of its broad appeal, and right now, there is revolution happening in California.

In Pursuit of Balance or IPOB is a thriving group of producers founded on the notion that California Pinot Noir should be balanced, rather than decadent and lush—the prevailing style over the past few decades. Has the focus shifted? There are compelling arguments on both sides of the issue.

It pays to do a little research, then, to figure out which producers are making fully ripe, high octane Pinots and those that are making a style that accents subtlety and vibrant acidity. Not that both styles can't be great, they can be.

Richer Pinot Noir, from warmer regions like the Russian River Valley tends to exhibit more dark fruit, in general, they are fuller wines with greater concentration and higher alcohol, up to 15% ABV.

Although red wines from Rioja are prized, Spanish wines generally offer great bang for the buck, allowing one to indulge in quality vino without breaking the bank!

There are four categories of red wine in Rioja. The youngest of these is “Joven”. “Crianza” wines are required to age for a minimum of 2 years, with 6 months spent in oak barrels. The next level is “Reserva” in which the wine ages for a minimum of 3 years, with at least 1 year in oak barrels. Finally, the most mature wines are labeled “Gran Reserva”. These wines mature for minimum 2 years in oak barrels, followed by at least 3 years in the bottle.

Typically younger wines will be lighter in body style, exhibit more fresh fruit characteristics and are suitable to drink while young. Older wines have more developed flavor profiles, earthy characteristics, and are better suited to aging.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

It's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity.",135,3.9,,0.048175490871895224,0.06861009742859338,,,

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

Nouveau is a classic wine at the Thanksgiving table—it loves roasted turkey and cranberry sauce, and it will also pair amiably with smoked salmon or trout, pork chops, quiche and charcuterie.",26,3.8,,0.12026726057906459,0.16162194509859115,,,

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide.",13396,4.4,,0.0051361881392751295,0.0018417357276964983,,,"Its pale and bright pink colour is adorned with warm glints of gold and its delicate slowly rising

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

Pinotage started in the 1920s when a wine producer wanted to make a grape that grew as well as Cinsault, but had the characteristics of Pinot Noir. The result was something he did not expect.

The grape and wine that resulted was far darker than anticipated and little was known about how to best cultivate the crop. Irrespective of this fact, the grape was planted all over South Africa, was poorly bottled, and underwhelmed the international community until the last 20 or so years.

Nebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.

In Veneto, Valpolicella reigns supreme as its own distinct viticultural zone. There are five different tiers within this wine category ranging from inexpensive and light-bodied Valpolicella Classico, to pricey Amarone.

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made.

The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.

There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

The other principal grape grown in Burgundy is Pinot Noir.

Burgundy has had a long love affair with wine, starting around the 1st century AD with the Romans. Later, the Cistercian monks really put Burgundy on the map by crafting wines for the local aristocracy.

Widely viewed as the most terroir-driven of French wines, Burgundy wines, both red and white are made from varieties that easily reflect the soil and climate they are grown in. Like a blank canvas, Chardonnay readily expresses subtle variations from vineyards that are a mere stone's throw from one another, this is part of what makes Burgundy so compelling and so expensive.

As with other regions in France, Burgundy can range in price from expensive to reasonably affordable. Burgundy's vineyard sites have been carefully divided over the centuries into Grand Cru, Premier Cru, village appellations and regional wines (aka Bourgogne blanc).

Some things to keep in mind when selecting white Burgundy: It's more nuanced than New World Chardonnay, this restraint is reflected in the alcohol as well, which often falls between 12.5-13.5%.

Champagne has long been the wine of choice to celebrate special occasions, and its reputation as a luxury beverage has been intact since the Romans established vineyards in Reims in the 5th century (that's a really long time ago).

Sparkling Champagne wasn't discovered until the 16th century, by accident, by the Benedictine Monks. Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.

Champagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.

The convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide.",6360,3.9,,0.07513434122230724,0.04060084964700118,,,

Chardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?

Chardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects “terroir” (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.

Sonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics. Napa Valley Chards lean toward a riper and fuller style, with tropical fruit notes. Oak aging adds layers of vanilla, spice, butter and toasted hazelnut.

Oakier Chards with a slightly buttery profile have a natural affinity with rich seafood such as lobster or halibut.

Arguably, the two most important regions in Northern Italy are Piedmont in the northwest, and Veneto in the northeast. Red wines from these regions range from some of the most expensive and sought after in all of Italy to great value red wines.

Nebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.

Dolcetto and Barbera from Piedmont offer relative value. Dolcetto is planted on less desirable vineyard sites, and produces fruit-forward, great value wines that are meant to be consumed within 1-2 years of bottling. Barbera is a high yield variety with low tannins and high acidity.

In Veneto, Valpolicella reigns supreme as its own distinct viticultural zone. There are five different tiers within this wine category ranging from inexpensive and light-bodied Valpolicella Classico, to pricey Amarone.

Red wines from Valpolicella are typically based on Corvina, with Rondinella, and Molinara rounding out these blended wines.",18,2.9,,0.6544161206751726,0.6404133743103434,,,

These light and crisp roses have just the slightest touches of bright berry flavors and can complement a meal perfectly or be delightful on their own.

The dry, refreshing, pink wines of Provence may not be complicated or heady, but they are certainly lovely. These brightly flavored, yet pale colored wines are full of crisp acidity with light touches of tart red berries and citrus fruit.

These wines may not be serious, but you can't drink serious wines all of the time! Current trends are making these wines ridiculously popular, and for good reason.

They are the perfect summer wine and can make any light afternoon meal even better with their liveliness and pretty fruit. These are much lighter than most California roses, but are typically much fresher and sharper.",444,3.3,,0.2509586402468387,0.21582597121930638,,,"Pink dress, slightly salmon-colored, bright and clear. On the nose the bouquet is expressive and declines beautiful perfumes ranging from fresh peach to almond by way of wild strawberry and small spices. Like a bubble bursting, its soft and dashing flesh splashes the palate of a fresh saline and mineral.
