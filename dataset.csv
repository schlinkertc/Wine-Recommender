In 1922, Zweigelt was created by researcher Frank Zweigelt, by crossing an Austrian grape called Blaufränkish, which gives the wine its acidity, with St. Laurent, which imparts bright cherry flavors and a smooth texture.

Zweigelt is planted throughout Austria, with the most expressive wines coming from the Neusiedlersee DAC of Burgenland, in the easternmost part of country.

Cabernet Sauvignon is dry and full-bodied, and is prized for its long aging potential. It's also known for displaying characteristic green flavors like bell pepper, eucalyptus and mint.

Marlborough is the most revered wine-producing region in the small country, accounting for 62% of all wine produced in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc scene started popping in 1970s, with the high quality Sauvignon Blancs coming out of Marlborough illustrating the great potential for grape growing in New Zealand.

Sauvignon Blanc tends to be fermented in stainless steel vats, which results in a clean, crisp flavor, and will not show any of that butteriness that is often prevalent in well-oaked Chardonnay for instance.

Nebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.

In Veneto, Valpolicella reigns supreme as its own distinct viticultural zone. There are five different tiers within this wine category ranging from inexpensive and light-bodied Valpolicella Classico, to pricey Amarone.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

Chardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?

Chardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects “terroir” (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.

Sonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics. Napa Valley Chards lean toward a riper and fuller style, with tropical fruit notes. Oak aging adds layers of vanilla, spice, butter and toasted hazelnut.

Oakier Chards with a slightly buttery profile have a natural affinity with rich seafood such as lobster or halibut.

Marlborough is the most revered wine-producing region in the small country, accounting for 62% of all wine produced in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc scene started popping in 1970s, with the high quality Sauvignon Blancs coming out of Marlborough illustrating the great potential for grape growing in New Zealand.

Sauvignon Blanc tends to be fermented in stainless steel vats, which results in a clean, crisp flavor, and will not show any of that butteriness that is often prevalent in well-oaked Chardonnay for instance.

When it comes to pairing, think white meat, shellfish, and try to accentuate the herbaceous qualities of the wine with ingredients like parsley and cilantro.",162,3.6,,0.18184704276326233,0.12238024275078582,,,"Aromas of passionfruit, lime zest and white nectarine with subtle musky complexity.

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.

Nouveau is a classic wine at the Thanksgiving table—it loves roasted turkey and cranberry sauce, and it will also pair amiably with smoked salmon or trout, pork chops, quiche and charcuterie.",62,3.9,,0.003105590062111801,0.037737075595533895,,,,France,1,Red

The other principal grape grown in Burgundy is Pinot Noir.

Burgundy has had a long love affair with wine, starting around the 1st century AD with the Romans. Later, the Cistercian monks really put Burgundy on the map by crafting wines for the local aristocracy.

Widely viewed as the most terroir-driven of French wines, Burgundy wines, both red and white are made from varieties that easily reflect the soil and climate they are grown in. Like a blank canvas, Chardonnay readily expresses subtle variations from vineyards that are a mere stone's throw from one another, this is part of what makes Burgundy so compelling and so expensive.

As with other regions in France, Burgundy can range in price from expensive to reasonably affordable. Burgundy's vineyard sites have been carefully divided over the centuries into Grand Cru, Premier Cru, village appellations and regional wines (aka Bourgogne blanc).

Some things to keep in mind when selecting white Burgundy: It's more nuanced than New World Chardonnay, this restraint is reflected in the alcohol as well, which often falls between 12.5-13.5%.

The grape and wine that resulted was far darker than anticipated and little was known about how to best cultivate the crop. Irrespective of this fact, the grape was planted all over South Africa, was poorly bottled, and underwhelmed the international community until the last 20 or so years.

Expect bright and fresh acidity with prevailing lemon, green apple, kiwi and pear. You will also enjoy fennel, mushroom, and a hint of grass. The wine is dry and should  be served chilled.

This wine pairs really well with poached proteins and shellfish. The acidity cuts through and compliments asparagus, tomatoes, olives, and greens with vinaigrette dressing. The wine isn't known for longevity and should be consumed within 3-4 years of bottling.",22,3.5,,0.3522622721714319,0.28402429379050115,,,,Spain,2,White

It's actually closer to Champagne than much of the rest of Burgundy, because it is separated by the Morvan hills.

Chablis produces dry white wines made from Chardonnay, and is situated on ancient Jurassic soils that give its wines minerally and flinty accents.

In fact, some of the best vineyard sites have a unique soil type known as Kimmeridgean, a distinctive mix of limestone, clay and fossilized oyster shells. The soil in combination with the cooler climate gives Chablis its distinctive flavor profile as well as a lovely pale gold-green color.

As with the rest of Burgundy, Chablis is classified by a strict hierarchy. The vast majority of wines on the market bear the Chablis regional label – they are often excellent wines that are attractively priced.

Premier Crus and Grand Crus are from top vineyard sites, and while more expensive, they also age beautifully.

Fresh and vibrant, Chablis has transporting aromas of green apples, lemon zest, spring flowers, and characteristic flint and chalk notes.

Chablis can be enjoyed year-round, but it is a particularly excellent wine to serve in the springtime and early summer, as Chablis loves oysters, mussels, sushi, green salads, asparagus, peas and just about anything with goat cheese.",27,3.8,,0.28927827760971203,0.19039888976505642,,,,France,2,White

The other principal grape grown in Burgundy is Pinot Noir.

Burgundy has had a long love affair with wine, starting around the 1st century AD with the Romans. Later, the Cistercian monks really put Burgundy on the map by crafting wines for the local aristocracy.

Widely viewed as the most terroir-driven of French wines, Burgundy wines, both red and white are made from varieties that easily reflect the soil and climate they are grown in. Like a blank canvas, Chardonnay readily expresses subtle variations from vineyards that are a mere stone's throw from one another, this is part of what makes Burgundy so compelling and so expensive.

As with other regions in France, Burgundy can range in price from expensive to reasonably affordable. Burgundy's vineyard sites have been carefully divided over the centuries into Grand Cru, Premier Cru, village appellations and regional wines (aka Bourgogne blanc).

Some things to keep in mind when selecting white Burgundy: It's more nuanced than New World Chardonnay, this restraint is reflected in the alcohol as well, which often falls between 12.5-13.5%.

Less famous yet very interesting are the Sicilian wines from Mount Etna. The higher altitude yields wines that are lighter, fresh and complex. The indigenous grape Nerello Mascalese offers some fine examples.

In Campania and the northern part of Basilicata, winemakers have been finding success with the grape Aglianico (pronounced “ahl-YAH-nee-koe”). The slightly colder climate is ideal for this grape and produces wines that are garnet-colored with high tannins and acidity.

Beaujolais produces light, dry red wines made from Gamay. Perhaps what the region is best known for is Beaujolais Nouveau, a fresh and fruity red wine made for immediate consumption.

Beaujolais is described as a refreshing red with low tannins and bright acidity. Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruit aromas are the hallmark of these wines. The more serious Beaujolais Crus sport mineral and earthy notes, as well as tart cranberry and violet overtones.

Some 35 million bottles of Beaujolais Nouveau are packed and shipped worldwide, within two months of harvest, hitting US shores around Thanksgiving! Roughly one-third of Beaujolais' production is dedicated to producing wines in the quaffable Nouveau style.

The remaining production is typically labeled as Beaujolais-Villages and there are 10 distinctive Crus, which are from distinct vineyard sites. Beaujolais Crus, unlike Nouveau wines, are darker in color, richer and fuller in body and can withstand some aging.
